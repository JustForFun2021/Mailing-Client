In this project we are going to build a mailing client.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - SMTP 

smtp is a protocol that we're going to use to sends mails.

In this script we takes our script and log into an existing 
mailing account and then use the smtp protocol with the py
script in order to send mails from that account to other 
accounts.

*** We cannot send mails directly from py script ,
    We use py script to login to our existing mail account
    and then use the smtp protocol to send mails from there.
** My recommendations:
   1. use a "damy mail" mail . 
   2. IN the PASWORD layer!!!
      encrypted in text file then load that text file
      decrypt  it and then use that password
